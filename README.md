# webpack-angular-advanced 

A step above the bare-bones webpack-angular application, with more advanced Webpack and Angular functionality. Still thinking through the best way to group templates, routes, controllers together within the Webpack worldview. See http://rok3.me/programming/managing-angular-dependencies-webpack/ for more details on webpack dependency management with Angular.

Just run "npm install" in the project directory. This will install the appropriate dependencies. Then run "npm start" and view your app at "localhost:8080".
